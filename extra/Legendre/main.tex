\section{Derivation of the differential equation}

Legendre polynomials appear when we solve for example Laplace's equation in the spherical coordinate representation.
In particular, Legendre polynomials arise when there is azimuthal symmetry, and the associated Legendre polynomials arise when we consider the full angular decomposition of solutions.
Let us see this organically.
Laplace's equation is generically given as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \laplacian \phi(\va*{r}) = 0
.\end{eqnarray}
In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Bigg[ \frac{1}{r^2} \pdv{r} \Big( r^2 \pdv{r} \Big) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin{\theta}} \pdv{\theta} \Big( \sin{\theta} \pdv{\theta} \Big) + \frac{1}{r^2 \sin^2{\theta}} \pdv[2]{\phi} \Bigg] \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0
.\end{eqnarray}
If we pose a separable ansatz for the solution $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R(r) P(\theta) T(\phi)$, then the equation reduces to
\begin{align}
    \underbrace{ \frac{\sin^2{\theta}}{ R(r)} \dv{r} \Big( r^2 \dv{R(r)}{r} \Big) + \frac{\sin{\theta}}{P(\theta)} \dv{\theta} \Big( \sin{\theta} \dv{P(\theta)}{\theta} \Big) }_{F(r,\theta)} + \underbrace{ \frac{1}{T(\phi)} \dv[2]{T(\phi)}{\phi} }_{G(\phi)} = 0
.\end{align}
It is clear from this that both functions $F$ and $G$ are constants with respect to $\phi$.
Let us have 
\begin{align}
    G(\phi) = -m^2 \Rightarrow \dv[2]{T}{\phi} + m^2 T = 0 \Rightarrow T(\phi) = e^{\pm im\phi}
,\end{align}
We know that the form of the solution in $\phi$ must be periodic such that $T(\phi + 2\pi) = T(\phi)$\footnote{This is what led us to choose a negative constant for $G$ in the first place too.}.
This constraint forces $m \in \Z$\footnote{The set $\Z = \{ \ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2 \}$ is the collection of integers.}.

From this constraint, we can also write
\begin{align}
    F(r,\theta) = m^2
,\end{align}
which leads to
\begin{align}
    \underbrace{ \frac{1}{R(r)}\dv{r} \Big( r^2 \dv{R(r)}{r} \Big) }_{ H(r) } + \underbrace{ \frac{1}{\sin{\theta} P(\theta)} \dv{\theta} \Big( \sin{\theta} \dv{P(\theta)}{\theta} \Big) - \frac{m^2}{\sin^2{\theta}} }_{ I(\theta) } = 0
.\end{align}
Again, $H$ and $I$ must be independent of $r$ and $\theta$, and we will set $I(\theta) = -\lambda$, which also means that $H(r) = \lambda$.
Typically, we write the eigenvalue in a convenient form, but here we will remain oblivious to its form and recover the conventional $l(l+1)$ behavior later.
For now, we ignore the radial dependence.
The solution is not terribly difficult, but the associated Legendre polynomials we care about are the solutions to azimuthal angle dependent differential equation:
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}} \dv{\theta}\Big( \sin{\theta} \dv{P(\theta)}{\theta} \Big) + \Big[ \lambda - \frac{m^2}{\sin^2{\theta}} \Big] P(\theta) = 0
.\end{align}
This is equivalent to Legendre's equation, but we can write it in its canonical form via the substitution $x = \cos{\theta}$.
The differential operator then transforms as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \dv{\theta} = \dv{x}{\theta} \dv{x} = \sin{\theta} \dv{x} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \dv{x}
,\end{eqnarray}
and therefore,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:associated-legendre-eq}
    \Bigg[ \dv{x} (1 - x^2) \dv{x} - \frac{m^2}{1-x^2} \Bigg] P(x) = -\lambda P(x)
.\end{eqnarray}
This equation is exactly of the SL form with $p(x) = 1 - x^2,~ q(x) = \\ -m^2/(1-x^2),~{\rm and}~r(x) = 1$.

\section{Series solution with $m=0$}

The differential equation \eref{associated-legendre-eq} is generally true, but we can simplify our life a bit to begin by considering azimuthally symmetric solutions.
That is, $m = 0$, giving
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:legendre-m0}
    \dv{x} (1 - x^2) \dv{P(x)}{x} + \lambda P_{l}(x) = 0
.\end{eqnarray}
It will actually be seen later that we can obtain the solution for nonzero $m$ from this special case.

It is not clear the above equation how to express $P_{l}$ in terms of elementary functions, so we will solve the equation using Frobenius' method, which means that we write $P_{l}$ as a power series
\begin{align}
    P(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n} x^{n + \gamma}
\end{align}
and solve for the coefficients $a_{n}$ and $\gamma$ such that $P$ satisfies Legendre's equation.
The introduction of $\gamma$ allows the leading power of the expansion to potentially vary as well as make the powers non-integer.
Putting this into \eref{legendre-m0}, we have
\begin{gather}
    \dv{x}(1 - x^2) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+\gamma) a_{n} x^{n+\gamma-1} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \lambda a_{n} x^{n+\gamma} = 0 \nonumber \\
    \dv{x} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+\gamma) a_{n} x^{n+\gamma-1} - \dv{x} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+\gamma) a_{n} x^{n+\gamma+1} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \lambda a_{n} x^{n+\gamma} \nonumber \\
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+\gamma) (n+\gamma-1) a_{n} x^{n+\gamma-2} - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+\gamma)(n+\gamma+1) a_{n} x^{n+\gamma} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \lambda a_{n} x^{n + \gamma} \nonumber \\
    \sum_{n=-2}^{\infty} (n+\gamma+2)(n+\gamma+1) a_{n+2} x^{n+\gamma} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} [ \lambda - (n+\gamma)(n+\gamma+1) ] a_{n} x^{n+\gamma}
.\end{gather}
Shifting the indices of the first sum so that $n \rightarrow n+2$, we arrive at 
\begin{align}
    \gamma &(\gamma - 1) a_{0} x^{\gamma - 2} + (\gamma + 1)(\gamma + 2) a_{1} x^{\gamma - 1} \nonumber \\
                                             &+ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \Big\{ (n+\gamma+1)(n+\gamma+2)a_{n+2} + [ \lambda - (n+\gamma)(n+\gamma+1) ] a_{n} \Big\} x^{n+\gamma} = 0
.\end{align}
In order to have this expression be zero for every $x$, we must have the coefficients of each power of $x$ be identically zero.
For the first term, this means that
\begin{eqnarray}
    \gamma(\gamma - 1) = 0 \Rightarrow \gamma = 0~{\rm or}~1
.\end{eqnarray}
These two solutions for $\gamma$ are what give us our two solutions of the differential equation.
For either value of $\gamma$, we must have
\begin{eqnarray}
    a_1 = 0
.\end{eqnarray}
since $(\gamma + 1)(\gamma+2) > 0$.
Focusing now on the coefficient inside the sum, we obtain the recurrence relation
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:legendre-rec-rel}
    a_{n+2} = \frac{(n+\gamma)(n+\gamma+1) - \lambda}{(n+\gamma+1)(n+\gamma+2)} a_{n}
.\end{align}
We can see immediately from this that the odd terms $a_{2n+1} = 0$ since these are recursively related to $a_1$.

This is where we determine the value of $\lambda$.
The basis of this is that a power series solution must converge.
